How to use Squiggly examples
===================================

To build and run an example, please follow these steps:

1. Import the project into Flex Builder 3 or Flash Builder 4 beta.

2. Copy the dictionary data (including the AdobeSpellingConfig.xml file and the dictionaries folder) from ../src to <project>/src folder. If you want to place the dictionary files in a different folder, please make sure the url is referred correctly in the code or in AdobeSpellingConfig.xml file.

3. Copy the Squiggly lib(s) from ../libs to <project>/libs folder
   - CheckWord, GetSuggestion, TextEditor needs only AdobeSpellingEngine.swc
   - SquigglyUIExample, ContextMenuWithResource, CustomContextMenu needs both AdobeSpellingEngine.swc and AdobeSpellingUI.swc
   - SquigglyTLFExample needs AdobeSpellingUIForTLF.swc

4. Build the project
